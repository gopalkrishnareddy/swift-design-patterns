# [Swift Design Patterns][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]

As you grow your skills as a coder, it's important go beyond language syntax and functionality. Design patterns have evolved over the years to solve common problems that arise in development. Once you learn a design pattern, you'll use it over and over in many different languages. However, design patterns themselves can be abstract and hard to understand at first. For this reason, it is important to see specific examples so you can relate to the patterns and the specific scenarios they relate to.

In this course, Derek will teach you some of the most common patterns. More importantly, he will explain and demonstrate how these patterns can be applied using the Swift programming language. For each pattern, you'll see a complete example in code and you'll get an explanation of the specific challenge the pattern is solving. By the end, you'll have some powerful new coding tools in your toolkit.
